<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The Tale of Ashley Boston</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By Ashley Boston</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Preface (from the prospective of my boyfriend)</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I reached in the box, and, knowing what it was, pulled it out. It was a huge bra, with the tag size 27H. I’ve dreamed about Ashley knocking me out with those huge melons, and now my dream has come true.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chapter 1- Introduction</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I, a beautiful, sexy blond assassin (with huge breasts), target the bigger government organizations of the world, and also date cute boys. I, in a sense, am the deadliest assassin in the whole world. I was trained in many types of martial arts, so I can be seriously deadly. Another thing I found I had are a feminine power, called knockout farts. They knock people out when they take a wiff of it. I can knock out a grown man, even though I am only 18. I can also mesmerize people, because of my “private” features. I now must continue searching for my target, the CIA.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chapter 2 - The finding</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">After a while, my hacker found where they keep their private stuff. It’s somewhere, I tell you, but I won’t tell you where. I get my leather teddy ready with my OTK high thigh boots, because it helps me, in one way and another. The first reason is that it helps me keep flexible, because it only covers my body, not my legs or my arms. It also helps because it mesmerizes the guards since it barely covers my private features. I got on the plane and set off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chapter 3 - The assassination of the guard</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I jumped off the plane, flew low and landed off site. When I flew off, though, I caught a glimpse of it. They were fully prepared for an attack. Turns out that the hacker wasn’t trustable after all. They’re dead when I get back. Anyway, I start my journey to the base. When I got close, I found the main entrance. A double-iron piston door, opened by a keycard. There was one guard at the main entrance. I slowly snuck up and entered the guard shack. The guard, mesmerized, let me dance on his lap. I playfully gave him a dance on the lap, and I also followed up on messaging his shoulders. What he didn’t know is, I’ve already planned his death. After a while, after he was starting to trust me, I acted. I crawled on his knees, and he, thinking I was doing something else, let me. I slowly took off my suit, watching him stare at my chest, so close up. I then also took off my bra and felt his “private part” start poking up. I then, unexpectedly, took his head and pulled it at my chest. He was rested until he started having a lack of oxygen. I taunted him, saying,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Are my breasts making it hard to breathe?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He squirmed a little bit more and then he just fell over, unconscious. I then snapped his neck. He opened his eyes. His eyeballs rolled back and he fell down, dead before he could even hit the floor. I dragged him to an edge, and then I put my bra and suit on. Then I grabbed his keycard and walked over to open the door.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chapter 4 - The assassination of more guards</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I walked in. Immediately, a guard appeared, and the guard, like the other one, was mesmerized. I kicked his head with my heel and he lay down, unconscious. I then sat on his neck and snapped it. When I continued walking down the hall, another guard appeared. He did not get mesmerized, but I ran up to him and ripped his weapon from his hands. He knew I wanted to do it the old fashioned way and he raised up his fists. Little did he know, I had much more experience on killing than him. I whipped my foot to his head and he was rendered unconscious. I then walked over to the door, and invited the other guard in. This guard was mesmerized, and followed my instructions, dropping his weapon. I then blind sided him, knocking him to the floor where I strangle him with a leg lock, and then moving around, delivering several kicks to the balls. Then I finished him off with a neck snap. Another guard appears at the hallway and he runs toward me. When he got close enough, I swung my hand and knocked him out by hitting the side of his neck. I continue down the hallway to a room, where I find the CIA boss, hard at work. I will not be ignored… and I maneuver him to the couch where I seductively message his shoulders. He, mesmerized, relaxes, not bothering to ask who I am. Then, in a flash, I latch onto his head and in one move, snaps his neck. By the time his head hit the ground, he is dead. I snatched up my USB and downloaded all the files on his computer and after, I left the building, snapping the unconscious guard’s neck and looking at all the guards that I had killed.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chapter 5 - The killing of the hacker</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When I arrived at my base, I quietly sneak over to the hacker’s room and quickly, give him a flurry of kicks and punches until, I jumped on his shoulders and flipped him onto the ground. He screams in pain until I released my wind at his face. A quiet little ‘pfft’ and he is unconscious on the ground. I then snap his neck to kill him. I guess females are the most deadliest after all. I changed and then I drove home to meet my boyfriend.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chapter 6 - My boyfriend</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My date doesn’t know that I’m an assassin. He thinks I’m just a good, super pretty boxer. When I arrived at home, my boyfriend was giddy with joy. The reason is because I promised him that I would have a smothering session with him when I arrived at home. I walked upstairs and walked into his bedroom, and then he came racing in. I walked up to him, and asked him. “Are you ready?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He replied, “Yes! I can’t wait!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As I kicked off my shoes I told him, “If you tap out, I will not revive you. You’ll have to wake by yourself. If you agree, then go on your knees and unbuckle and unzip my jeans.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He obviously lost his self-control as he went on his knees and did as I said. As I pulled down my jeans, I told him to do the same. As I did this, I could see him staring at me and twitching. I then asked him,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“You sure you’re ready?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He replied, “Yes!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I pulled off my shirt, and he stared at my chest as I did so. Then I could tell he was having a good time as I reached behind my back and unclipped my bra. My bra fell to the ground, and I could see that he was very happy. I told him to lie down on the bed and he reluctantly did so. I then climbed onto the bed and leaned down in front of him so that he could see my huge breasts. I put my breasts on his face, saying,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Hmm… I could knock you out with these! You want to?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I heard a ‘mmmmm’ and I briefly removed my chest from his face. He said,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Yes, please, I would love for you to knock me out cold with your melons, Ashley!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He was giddy with joy as I put my breasts back on his face, kind of hanging. The most effective. He was pretty relaxed at first but after about 10 seconds he started squirming because of the lack of air. I started taunting him like the guard, making his man-pride take over.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Hey, aren’t you having fun in there?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He started squirming and trying to push me off, but I had locked onto him using the grapevine hold.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Poor little boy, beaten by a girl’s breasts!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He started going crazy, and I could feel him weakening. After 5 seconds, I could hear muffled shouts.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“What are you saying? I can’t hear you!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Then when I felt like he was about to yell that he is submitting, I briefly lift my breasts up and I hear him scream,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“I give up, my beautiful Ashley!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">then I placed my breasts back on his head.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Not over yet, my boy, you’re not leaving that easily.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">His squirming got slower and weaker, and then the squirming stopped completely. As I raised my chest off his head, his head lolled, unconscious. I decided to play with his body.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Let’s see what’s under there, my boy.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I pulled down his underpants, and his “private” part flopped and stood up straight. I placed my melons on “the part” and, with care, jiggled them up and down. About 5 minutes after that, he started waking up, because of the cold wind on his ‘part’. I could hear his weak voice saying,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“What are you doing, Ashley?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I replied, “Don’t worry, I’m taking care.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He sat straight up and saw what I was doing. I could feel it twitch between my breasts. Suddenly, without warning, a stream of yellow liquid spurted out, hitting my chin and then soaking my breasts. I screamed with surprise as it spurted everywhere. I knocked him out cold with a quick hit to the side of his neck and the squirting stream stopped. I got up and took a shower. After an hour, he awoke again. He thinking that I wasn’t there, took advantage and quickly put on his clothes. I snuck out of his room and pretended that I was downstairs. When he got downstairs, he apologized mercifully.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry, Ashley. I didn’t realize that’ll happen.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I replied, “It’s ok, I knew that it’ll happen eventually. It’s my specialty. I can make boys get wet willies.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He was relieved. He asked me,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“How did you knock me out with one hit?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I realized that I had to tell him, so I truthfully admitted.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“I’m the deadliest assassin in the world.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I closed my eyes, wishing that he doesn’t dump me.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Don’t worry, I still love you. It’s ok to have secrets. But, can you still be my girlfriend?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I was gratefully relieved. I replied,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Yes, I can. I love you too”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He grinned.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Guess you can sure protect me!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I grinned back.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Want to try again tomorrow?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He gave me the pose that obviously said ‘yes’.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chapter 7 - An intruder</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At night, I was sleeping with my boyfriend, as usual, and I heard something. Looking at my boyfriend, it seems as if he heard it as well. We both crawled out of bed and saw a masked figure going through the house, searching for something. I snuck up behind the masked figure and jump-kicked him. The masked figure slumped down on the floor, unconscious. I pulled off his mask and saw that he was sent by the CIA. I quickly dragged him out of the house and snapped his neck. My boyfriend was impressed and scared at the same time as I led him back to the bedroom.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chapter 8 - Another smothering session</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He took off his pants as I also did the same. He asked,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Can I try harder to get you off this time?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Of course you can,” I replied.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I seductively removed my shirt and my bra, as usual, and he, with delight, lied down on the bed.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Ready!” He said.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I put my breasts on his face and he instantly felt the realization that I had locked onto him. He was astonished and scared, since nobody ever could lock that quickly. He tried his best, to push me off, but I rode all his attempts and also taunted him each time.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Are my breasts hurting you? Oh, that’s too sad.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Aren’t you having fun in there, isn’t it so comfy and soft?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He started squirming and, eventually, used all his precious oxygen and tapped out. I smiled as I lifted my chest off his face. Now I can do my stuff. I yanked off his underwear and started to do the same as before. He started waking, stirring as he awoke. I got off. He rose to standing position and knew, again, what I was doing. I saw it twitch as he realized. He was more controlled this time, but still, unexpectedly, a squirt of yellow, splashing my body and chest. I screamed in delight and stood up. He tried to move his hands to cover it up but my assassin instincts took over and I kicked him in the face. He fell over, unconscious again.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I ran over to the shower and took one. I then walked over to him and sat down. I started doing the same thing again. This time, he woke up after 2 hours of me playing with his body. He, realizing that he just did it again, felt ashamed. His cheeks turned red and asked me,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“What happened?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I explained all that happened. He then asked me,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Can you smother me again?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I told him,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“If you promise that you won’t get a wet willie again,”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He promised as he climbed onto the bed and let me knock him out again. I placed my breasts on his face, and heard him moan in delight. After a while, again, without taunting though, he was soundly unconscious. I was delighted. I had knocked him out cold three times this day. I walked down to the main floor and waited. About 5 minutes later, I heard him walking down the stairs. He was in good shape, and he asked me a question.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Can you knock me out that way every day when we sleep?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I replied,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Sure!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He then peed his pants, again.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Chapter 9 - The arena fight</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I, with the recommendation of my boyfriend, joined a wrestling team. My first fight is today, and I am just getting ready. When they told me to put on my gloves, I refused. I didn’t need to. They put me in the arena with the other person. The other person, a boy, obviously got an erection. He started rubbing his ‘private part’ and also glancing at my chest. When the fight begun, I walked toward him. He, thinking that I’ll be weak, launched an assault at my face. I dodged all of his assaults. I then kicked him in the face and he fell down, almost unconscious. I stripped off my bra and engulfed my chest in his face. He screamed and squirmed and I taunted him.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“Oh, poor baby. Are my beautiful breasts hurting you?”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He squirmed even more until he yelled,</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“I submit!”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I briefly removed my breast so that everyone could hear. Then I put it back on. He slowly drifted into unconsciousness.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The boxing judge, smiling with pride, quickly told me to put my bra back on. I did so reluctantly and walked off the arena. I took my cash and drove home.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">At night, I did as I promised. I smothered him with my breasts and he would just fall unconscious after 10 seconds.</span></p>
